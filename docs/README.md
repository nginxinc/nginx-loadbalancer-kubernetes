This repo contains source code and documents for a new `Kubernetes Controller from Nginx`, that provides TCP and HTTP load balancing external to a Kubernetes Cluster running On Premises.

<br/>

>>**This is a replacement for a Cloud Providers `Service Type Loadbalancer`, that is not available for On Premises Kubernetes Clusters.**

<br/>
<br/>


# Overview

- `NLK - NGINX Loadbalancer for Kubernetes` is a new K8s Controller from Nginx, that monitors specified K8s Services, and then sends API calls to an external Nginx Plus server to manage Nginx Upstream servers dynamically.
- This will `synchronize` the K8s Service Endpoint list, with the Nginx LB Server's upstream list.
- The primary use case and Solution provided is for tracking the K8s` NodePort` IP:Port definitions for the Nginx Ingress Controller's `nginx-ingress Service`.
- NLK is a native Kubernetes Controller, running, configured and managed with standard K8s commands.
- NLK paired with the Nginx Plus Server located external to the K8s cluster, this new controller LB function will provide a `TCP Load Balancer Service` for On Premises K8s clusters, which do not have access to a Cloud providers "Service Type LoadBalancer".
- NLK paired with the Nginx Plus Server located external to the Cluster, using Nginx's advanced HTTP features, provide an `HTTP Load Balancer Service` for Enterprise traffic management solutions, such as:
    - MultiCluster Active/Active Load Balancing
    - Horizontal Cluster Scaling
    - HTTP Split Clients - for A/B, Blue/Green, and Canary test and production traffic steering.  Allows Cluster operations/maintainence like upgrades, patching, expansion and troubleshooting with no downtime or reloads
    - Advanced TLS Processing - MutualTLS, OCSP, FIPS, dynamic cert loading
    - Advanced Security features - Oauth, JWT, App Protect WAF Firewall, Rate and Bandwidth limits
    - Nginx Java Script (NJS) for custom solutions
    - Nginx Zone Sync of KeyVal data
