// These constants are intended for use in the Annotations field of the Service definition.
// They determine which Border Server client will be used.
// To use these values, add the following annotation to the Service definition:
//
//	annotations:
//	  nginxinc.io/nlk-<upstream name>: <value>
//
// where <upstream name> is the name of the upstream in the NGINX Plus configuration and <value> is one of the constants below.
//
// Note, this is an extensibility point. To add a Border Server client...
// 1. Create a module that implements the BorderClient interface;
// 2. Add a new constant to this group that acts as a key for selecting the client;
// 3. Update the NewBorderClient factory method in border_client.go that returns the client;
